## Development guide
This guide is for both humans and AI agents. Thank you for contributing to the project.

### Tech docs
Here is the tech we use and their docs:
- Svelte 5: https://svelte.dev/llms-small.txt
- Farcaster mini app SDK: https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/llms-full.txt

### Coding practices
- Always strive to write minimal, elegant code with best practices.
- Always check your work with svelte-check and linter: `just check`.
- The UI should be responsive and look good on mobile and desktop devices.

- View list of components: `ls ./src/lib/components/ui`
