# Stoa

Stoa is an app that encourages meaningful discussion and offers accurate insight into community sentiment.

## Developing

Here is the tech we use and their docs:
- Svelte 5: https://svelte.dev/llms-small.txt
- Farcaster mini app SDK: https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/llms-full.txt

Always strive to write minimal, elegant code with best practices. To add UI components, we use shadcn-svelte. You can add components with this command: `just shadcn-add <component-name>`.

You can find all component names here: https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/docs.
